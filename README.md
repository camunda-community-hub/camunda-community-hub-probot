# camunda-community-hub-probot

## The Camunda Community Hub Probot allows you to quickly add labels to issues by commenting and typing a slash command.

Usage: To add a label to an open issue, in the 'Leave a Comment' space enter the following:

```
/lm add label1, label2, label3
```
Once your comment is posted, after a few moments, the bot should apply the label you specified. To see the list of labels available to you in the Camunda Community Hub, please review our [steps for issue triage and labelling](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/blob/main/issue-triage.md). For more information on extension lifecycles and how to implement them, please [read the doumentation](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/blob/main/extension-lifecycle.md).
